# dubins

This package contains the Platform used in Rejoin tasks with Dubins dynamics,
along with all the necessary Platform parts. Controllers apply controls to thrusters and control
surfaces to interact with environment dynamics. Sensors measure various aspects
of the environment. All PlatformParts include a set of 
properties which define the range of values the Platform Part
can handle.

These Platforms and Platform Parts can interact directly with
entities in the environment simulation to read from or 
update the simulation state.
