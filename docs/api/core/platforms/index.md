# platforms

Platforms represent objects within the environment (vehicles, robots, etc.).
Platforms can contain multiple custom Platform Parts which
define platform behavior. The most common types of Platform
Parts are Controllers and Sensors. Controllers apply controls to thrusters and control
surfaces to interact with environment dynamics. Sensors measure various aspects
of the environment. Platform Parts are often analogous to the
parts used in a physical system.
