# dubins

This page contains the Platform used in Rejoin tasks with Dubins dynamics,
along with all the necessary Platform parts: Controllers, Sensors, Properties,
and AvailablePlatformTypes. Controllers apply controls to thrusters and control
surfaces to interact with environment dynamics. Sensors measure various aspects
of the environment. Properties define the range of values expected to be passed
to a given Controller.
