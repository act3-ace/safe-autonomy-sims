    Parameters
    ----------
    cut : DoneFunction
        The component under test
    observation : numpy.ndarray
        The observation array
    action : numpy.ndarray
        The action array
    next_observation : numpy.ndarray
        The next_observation array
    next_state : StateDict
        The StateDict that the DockingVelocityLimitDoneFunction mutates
    platform : MagicMock
        The mock platform to be returned to the DockingVelocityLimitDoneFunction when it uses get_platform_by_name()
