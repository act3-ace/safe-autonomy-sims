This package implements CoRL glues for the docking and inspection
environments.

Glues connect an agent [platform](../platforms/index.md) to an RL
training framework by providing an endpoint for observations and
actions.

A glue may transform and send data from a platform part to an RL
training framework as an observation. The full set of glues which
provide observations over all agents in the environment defines the
environment's observation space.

A glue may also transform and send data from a training framework to
a platform part as an action. The full set of glues which provide
actions over all agents in the environment defines the environment's
action space.

Multiple glues may be used in a decorator pattern to reuse common
transformation logic.
