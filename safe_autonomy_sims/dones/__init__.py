This package implements done functions for safe autonomy reinforcement
learning environments.

Done functions are called by [simulators](../simulators/index.md)
at each timestep of the simulation. These functions are tasked with
determining when an agent has reached a done condition for their
current training episode on a given task. They take in the current
and previous observation and action spaces and output a boolean value.
