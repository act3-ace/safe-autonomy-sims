    ## Environment

    In this weighted six dof inspection environment, the goal is for a single deputy spacecraft 
    to navigate around and inspect the entire surface of a chief spacecraft.

    The chief is covered in 100 inspection points that the agent must observe
    while they are illuminated by the moving sun. The points are weighted by
    priority, such that it is more important to inspect some points than others.
    A unit vector is used to indicate the direction of highest importance, where
    points are weighted based on their angular distance to this vector. All
    point weights add up to a value of one. The optimal policy will inspect
    points whose cumulative weight exceeds 0.95 within 2 revolutions of the sun
    while using as little fuel as possible.  
    
    In this six DOF inspection environment, the agent controls its translational
    and rotational movement, requiring it to orient itself towards the chief for
    inspection.
    
    __Note: the policy selects a new action every 10 seconds__

    ## Action Space

    Actions are thruster force values for each of the 3 bi-directional thrusters
    on the x-, y-, and z-axis of the deputy spacecraft's body frame and the
    reaction wheel abstraction controlling the deputy's x, y, and z moments with
    scalar values. These controls are able to move and rotate the spacecraft in
    any direction.

    The action space is a `Box` with the following bounds:

    | Index | Action        | Control Min | Control Max | Type (units) |
    |-------|---------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
    | 0     | x-axis thrust | -1          | 1           | Force (N)    |
    | 1     | y-axis thrust | -1          | 1           | Force (N)    |
    | 2     | z-axis thrust | -1          | 1           | Force (N)    |
    | 3     | x-axis moment | -0.001      | 0.001       | Moment (Nm)  |
    | 4     | y-axis moment | -0.001      | 0.001       | Moment (Nm)  |
    | 5     | z-axis moment | -0.001      | 0.001       | Moment (Nm)  |

    ## Observation Space

    At each timestep, the agent receives the observation,
    $o = [x, y, z, |pos|, |x|, |y|, |z|, v_x, v_y, v_z, |v|, |v_x|, |v_y|, |v_z|, \omega_{x}, \omega_{y}, \omega_{z}, \theta_{x}, \theta_{y}, \theta_{z}, f, \theta_{sun}, n, x_{ups}, y_{ups}, z_{ups}, x_{pv}, y_{pv}, z_{pv}, w_{points}, p_o]$, where:

    * $x, y,$ and $z$ represent the deputy's position relative to the chief,
    * $|pos|, |x|, |y|, |z|$ is the magnorm representation of the deputy's position relative to the chief
    * $v_x, v_y,$ and $v_z$ represent the deputy's directional velocity relative to the chief,
    * $|v|, |v_x|, |v_y|, |v_z|$ is the magnorm representation of the deputy's velocity relative to the chief
    * $\omega_x, \omega_y, \omega_z$ are the components of the deputy's angular velocity
    * $\theta_{cam}$ is the camera's orientation in Hill's frame
    * $\theta_{x}, \theta_{y}, \theta_{z}$ are the deputy axis coordinates in Hill's frame
    * $f$ is the dot-product between the camera orientation vector and the relative position between the deputy and the chief. This value is 1 when the camera is pointing at the chief.  
    * $\theta_{sun}$ is the angle of the sun,
    * $n$ is the number of points that have been inspected so far and,
    * $x_{ups}, y_{ups},$ and $z_{ups}$ are the unit vector elements pointing to the nearest large cluster of unispected points as determined by the *Uninspected Points Sensor*.
    * $x_{pv}, y_{pv},$ and $z_{pv}$ are the unit vector elements pointing to the priority vector indicating point priority.
    * $w_{points}$ is the cumulative weight of inpsected points
    * $p_o$ is the dot-product between the uninspected points cluster given by the Uninspected Points Sensor and the deputy's position. This signals if the uninspected points are occluded for if the camera is facing the points but they are not being inspected, there is occlusion.

    The observation space is a `Box` with the following bounds:

    | Index | Observation                                                 | Min | Max | Type (units) |

    ## State Transition Dynamics

    The relative motion between the deputy and chief is represented by
    linearized Clohessy-Wiltshire equations [[1]](#1), given by

    $$
        \dot{\boldsymbol{x}} = A {\boldsymbol{x}} + B\boldsymbol{u},
    $$

    where:
    * state $\boldsymbol{x}=[x,y,z,\dot{x},\dot{y},\dot{z}]^T \in \mathcal{X}=\mathbb{R}^6$
    * control $\boldsymbol{u}= [F_x,F_y,F_z]^T \in \mathcal{U} = [-1N, 1N]^3$

    * $$
        A =
    \begin{bmatrix}
    0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
    3n^2 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 2n & 0 \\

    0 & 0 & \frac{1}{m} \\
    \end{bmatrix},
    $$

    * mean motion constant $n = 0.001027 rad/s$

    The body frame rotational motion state transition of each spacecraft
    given its quaternion orientation and angular velocity
    $[q_1, q_2, q_3, q_4, \omega_x, \omega_y, \omega_z]$ is defined by

    $$
    \begin{bmatrix}
    \dot{q_1} \\
    \dot{q_2} \\
    \dot{q_3} \\
    \dot{q_4} \\
    \dot{\omega_x} \\
    \dot{\omega_y} \\
    \dot{\omega_z} \\
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \begin{bmatrix}
    \frac{1}{2}(q_4\omega_x - q_3\omega_y + q_2\omega_z) \\
    \frac{1}{2}(q_3\omega_x + q_4\omega_y - q_1\omega_z) \\
    \frac{1}{2}(-q_2\omega_x + q_1\omega_y + q_4\omega_z) \\
    \frac{1}{2}(-q_1\omega_x - q_2\omega_y - q_3\omega_z) \\
    J_1^{-1}((J_2 - J_3)\omega_y\omega_z) \\
    J_2^{-1}((J_3 - J_1)\omega_x\omega_z) \\
    J_3^{-1}((J_1 - J_2)\omega_x\omega_y) \\
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$

    where

    $$
    J =
    \begin{bmatrix}
    0.0573 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\
    0.0 & 0.0573 & 0.0 \\
    0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0573
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$
    
    is an inertial matrix.
    
    ## Rewards

    The reward $r_t$ at each time step is the sum of the following terms:

    * $r_t += 1.0(weight\_inspected\_points_t - weight\_inspected\_points_{t-1})$.
        * a dense reward for inspecting new points
    * $r_t += 1$ if $weight\_inspected\_points_i \geq 0.95$ and $FFT_radius \geq crash\_region\_radius$, $r = -1$ if $weight\_inspected\_points_i \geq 0.95$ and $FFT_radius < crash\_region\_radius$, else 0
        * a sparse reward for successfully inspecting the chief
        * positive reward for successful inspection and safe trajectory
        * negative reward for successful inspection and unsafe trajectory (FFT collision with chief)
    * $r_t += -1$ if $radius < crash\_region\_radius$, else 0
        * a sparse reward punishing the agent for crashing with the chief
    * $r_t += -1$ if $||pos_{chief} - pos_{deputy}|| > distance_{max}$, else 0.
        * a sparse reward punishing the agent for moving too far from the chief
    * $r_t += 0.001$ if $t < t_{max}$, else 0
        * a dense reward for staying alive
    * $r_t += 0.0005 * e^{-|\delta_t(f, 1)^2 / \epsilon|}$
        * a dense reward for facing the chief
        * $\delta_t(f, 1)$ is the difference between the $f$, dot-product between the camera orientation vector and the relative position between the deputy and the chief, and 1.
        * $\epsilon$ is the length of the reward curve for the exponential decay (configurable)
    * $r_t += -0.1||\boldsymbol{u}||$
        * a dense reward for minimizing thruster usage (fuel cost)

    ## Starting State

    At the start of an episode, the state is randomly initialized with the following conditions:

    * chief $(x,y,z)$ = $(0, 0, 0)$
    * chief radius = $10 m$
    * chief # of points = $100$
    * deputy position $(x, y, z)$ is converted after randomly selecting the position in polar notation $(r, \phi, \psi)$ using a uniform distribution with
        * $r \in [50, 100] m$
        * $\psi \in [0, 2\pi] rad$
        * $\phi \in [-\pi/2, \pi/2] rad$
        * $x = r \cos{\psi} \cos{\phi}$
        * $y = r \sin{\psi} \cos{\phi}$
        * $z = r \sin{\phi}$
    * deputy $(v_x, v_y, v_z)$ is converted after randomly selecting the velocity in polar notation $(r, \phi, \psi)$ using a Gaussian distribution with
        * $v \in [0, 0.3]$ m/s
        * $\psi \in [0, 2\pi] rad$
        * $\phi \in [-\pi/2, \pi/2] rad$
        * $v_x = v \cos{\psi} \cos{\phi}$
        * $v_y = v \sin{\psi} \cos{\phi}$
        * $v_z = v \sin{\phi}$
    * deputy $(\omega_x, \omega_y, \omega_z)$ is sampled from a uniform distribution between $[-0.01, -0.01, -0.01]$ rad/s and $[0.01, 0.01, 0.01]$ rad/s
    * deputy camera parameters:
        * field of view = $\pi$ rad
        * focal length = $1 m$
    * Initial sun angle is randomly selected using a uniform distribution
        * $\theta_{sun} \in [0, 2\pi] rad$
    * Simulator frame rate = $0.1 Hz$

    ## Episode End

    An episode will terminate if any of the following conditions are met:

    * Termination: the agent moves within a `crash_region_radius = 15` meter radius around the chief
    * Termination: the cumulative weight of inspected points exceeds 0.95
    * Truncation: the maximum number of timesteps, `max_timesteps = 12236`
    * Truncation: the agent exceeds a `max_distance = 800` meter radius away from the chief

    The episode is considered done and successful if and only if the cumulative weight of
    inspected points exceeds 0.95 while the deputy remains on a safe trajectory
    (not on a collision course with the chief).
