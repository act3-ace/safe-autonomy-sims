The `safe-autonomy-sims` package provides reinforement learning environments
built using the CoRL framework.

The included environments define safety-critical spacecraft docking and
spacecraft inspection tasks. The intent of these environments is to
provide a baseline for training RL agents to safely perform these tasks.
