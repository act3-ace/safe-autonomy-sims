This package implements Runtime Assurance modules for use
within the CoRL framework.

Runtime Assurance (RTA) is a safety technique which intercepts
a control or action before it is executed and checks it against
a well-defined safety constraint to see if the action is safe.
If the action is safe, the RTA module allows it to execute.
If the action is deemed **unsafe** the RTA module provides an
alternative action which is guaranteed to be safe under the assumption
that the system is already in a safe state.
