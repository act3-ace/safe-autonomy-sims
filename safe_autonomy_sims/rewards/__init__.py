This package implements the reward functions used across the
safe autonomy environments.

Rewards are used to incentivize certain [agent](../agents/index.md)
behavior during training. Over the course of a training episode,
the following reward functions take in current and previous
observations and actions and return a `RewardDict`,
allocating an appropriate reward (or penalty) to an agent based on
its behavior and the [simulation](../simulators/index.md) state.
